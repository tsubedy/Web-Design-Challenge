WEB VISUALIZATION DASHBOARD (LATITUDE)
(https://tsubedy.github.io/Web-Design-Challenge/index.html)

For this assignment a visualization dashboard website is created using visualizations that wer created in a past assignment. Specifically, plotting weather data.

In building this dashboard, created individual pages for each plots and a means by which can navigate among them. These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. there is also a landing page, a page where one can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where it can be viewed the data used to build them.

Website Requirements:
The website consist of total of 7 pages, including:

1. A landing page containing (index.html):
- An explanation of the project.
- Links to each visualizations page. There should be a sidebar containing preview images of each plot, and clicking an image should take the user to that 
visualization.

2. Four visualization pages (1.temperature.html, 2.humidity.html, 3. cloudiness.html, 4. windspeed.html) 
each with a descriptive title and heading tag.
- The plot itself for the selected comparison.
- A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.

4. A “Comparisons” page that (comparison.html):
- Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them.
- Bootstrap grid is used for the visualizations.
- The grid has two visualizations across on screens medium and larger, and 1 across on extra-small and small screens.

5. A “Dataset” page that (dataset.html):
- Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.
- The table is a bootstrap table component.

6. The website, at the top of every page, have a navigation menu that (index.html):
- Has the name of the site on the left of the nav which allows users to return to the landing page from any page.
- Contains a dropdown menu on the right of the navbar named “Plots” that provides a link to each individual visualization page.
- Provides two more text links on the right: “Comparisons,” which links to the comparisons page, and “Data,” which links to the data page.
- Is responsive (using media queries). The nav must have similar behavior as the screenshots “Navigation Menu” section (background color changes).

Considerations:
The weather data is used with the included cities dataset and pulled the images from the assets folder.
Bootstrap is used that includes the use of Bootstrap navbar component for the header on every page, the bootstrap table component for the data page, and the Bootstrap grid for responsiveness on the comparison page.

The website is deployed to GitHub pages, with the website working on a live, publicly accessible URL as a result.
CSS media query for the navigation menu. 
The website works at all window widths/sizes.

Screenshots:
This section contains screenshots of each page that are built, at varying screen widths as saved in the folder "screenshots":
